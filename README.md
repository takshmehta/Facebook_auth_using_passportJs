I would like to mention that I have created this project under the of Mr.Hitesh Choudhary{https://www.youtube.com/user/hiteshitube}.

Special thanks to these two youtube videos without which several configurations would have been impossible:
For configuring Git and Vscode : https://youtu.be/Fk12ELJ9Bww
For deploying NodeJs in Heroku : https://youtu.be/72DYDMP09MM
